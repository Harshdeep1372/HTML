        <li>W.W.W.</li>
        <p>WWW can be defined as the collection of different websites around the world,
             containing different information shared via local servers(or computers).The 
             World Wide Web is based on several different technologies: Web browsers, 
             Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). </p>
        <li>Website</li>
        <p>A website is a collection of files accessed through a web address, 
            covering a particular theme or subject, and managed by a particular 
            person or organization. Its opening page is called a home page.</p>
        <li>Client-server architecture</li>
        <p>Client server architecture is a computing model in which the server 
            hosts, delivers, and manages most of the resources and services requested by the client. 
            It is also known as the networking computing model or client server network</p>
        <li>Domain</li>
        <p>A domain name is the identity of one or more IP addresses; for example, the domain name 
            google.com points to the IP address "74.125.127.147".In simple words, suppose your website 
            is a house, then the domain name is its address.</p>
        <li>Hosting</li>
        <p>A hosting is a place where files are stored. Normally a company offers its web hosting 
            services by renting its servers to store the web, making it easier for other users to access it.</p>
        <li>Address bar</li>
        <p>The address bar is the narrow text field at the top of a Web browser where the currently 
            displayed website address appears. It is also called the Universal Resource Locator (URL).</p>
        <li>Title bar</li>
        <p>The title bar at the top of a window displays an application-defined icon and line of text</p>
        <li>Extension</li>
        <p>Extensions tell your computer which application created or can open the file and which icon to use for the file. 
            For example, .pdf (Portable Document Format), .xls (Microsoft Excel), .htm (Hypertext Markup Language), and 
            .jsp (Javaâ„¢ Server Page).</p>
        <li>File type</li>
        <p>A file type describes the structure or format of a file and is typically reflected in the file name extension.
            File types define how files and organizational data are stored in a business.
        </p>
        <li>URL/URI</li>
        <p>URI is an acronym for a Uniform Resource Identifier. URL is an acronym for a Uniform Resource Locator.
            A URI is a string identifier that refers to a resource on the internet.
            A URL is used to find the location of the resource on the web. </p>
